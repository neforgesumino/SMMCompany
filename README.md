A small website with simple HTML5 structure, CSS3 and a little bit of JS. JS part took the most efforts. I tried to better off my knowledge of Flexbox whilst working on that one. All pics are from google.
I used, and little bit altered, premade colour palettes so that I did not have to think too much about colours unlike in my Bootstrap 4 project, see Confectionery Company, google flatuicolors for the palettes.
